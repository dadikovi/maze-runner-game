# Maze runner game

This is a very simple 2D HTML5 game. You have to drop a key in the target field before the ghost catch you.

[Here is a playable demo](https://dadikovi.github.io/maze-runner-game-demo.html)

### Control

- Move player: W - A - S - D
- Drop key: Q
- Start / continue game: [space]

### TODO

- This project was developed under one night, currently it needs a major refactor.
- Also, the movement of ghost should be better.

Feel free to use this code for any purpose. Pull requests are also welcomed.
